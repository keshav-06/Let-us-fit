### Human Computer Interaction Project

## Introduction
In today's world, fitness is no longer just a hobby, but a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise not only helps to manage body weight, but also reduces the risk of heart disease, certain types of cancer, and strengthens bones and muscles. In order to support this growing need for physical activity, we introduce a new product called Lets Fit. This product is not only affordable but also user-friendly and easy to learn. Lets Fit utilizes the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and a Lipo battery as its primary hardware components. In addition, we make use of various software applications and online services such as the Arduino IDE and Visual Studio Code Extension for Arduino. Furthermore, the project will require the use of body tools and fabrication machines including a soldering iron, lead-free solder wire, and solder flux to assemble the device. The core feature of Lets Fit is human activity recognition, which involves detecting and classifying human activities from sensor data such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Our goal is to create a reliable and accurate device that can monitor and track human activities in real-time, thus promoting a healthier and more active lifestyle.

## Conclusion
I achieved my goals and created the desired product. The functionalities of tracking calories burnt and rechargeability are working as expected. The code has been made open source and the device is teachable as planned. As per observations, it can successfully track any exercise it faces. The implementation was lengthy but straightforward and the end product is highly reliable while also being extremely cost-effective. Future scope remains for added functionalities and higher complexity of calculations to get more detailed fitness tracking measurements.
